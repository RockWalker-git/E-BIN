# **E-Bin: A Smart Waste Management System 🗑️♻️**
## **Project Overview:**

E-Bin is an innovative waste management solution designed to automate the sorting and monitoring of garbage. Utilizing Arduino as the microcontroller, 
this system incorporates a moisture sensor, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, LED, buzzer, and LCD to efficiently categorize wet and dry waste.

## **Key Features:**

Moisture Sensing: Accurately determines the moisture content of waste to classify it as wet 💧 or dry ☀️.

Ultrasonic Level Detection: Monitors the fullness of the bin using an ultrasonic sensor, preventing overflow. 🗑️🚫

Automatic Sorting: A servo motor is employed to direct waste into appropriate bins based on moisture content. 🤖🔄

Real-time Information: An LCD display provides users with up-to-date information about the bin's status, including fullness and waste type. 📊🔍

Audio Alerts: A buzzer alerts users when the bin is full or when there are issues with the sorting process. 🚨🔊

## **Demo Instructions:**

Connect Hardware: Assemble the circuit according to the provided schematic, ensuring proper connections between the Arduino, sensors, actuators, and display. 🔌🔗

Upload Code: Transfer the compiled Arduino code onto the microcontroller. 🚀💻

Place Waste: Introduce wet and dry waste into the bin. 🗑️♻️

Observe Sorting: Watch as the servo motor automatically directs the waste into the appropriate bin based on moisture content. 🤖🔄

Monitor Status: The LCD display will continuously update with information about the bin's fullness and waste type. 📊🔍

Listen for Alerts: The buzzer will sound when the bin is full or if there are any malfunctions. 🚨🔊

## **Additional Notes:**

For optimal performance, ensure the moisture sensor is calibrated accurately. 🌡️✅

The ultrasonic sensor should be positioned to avoid obstructions that may interfere with its measurements. 📡🚫

Adjust the servo motor's position and speed to optimize the sorting process. ⚙️🔧

Customize the code to suit specific requirements or add additional features. 🎨💡

## ** Conclusion:**

E-Bin demonstrates a practical application of electronics and programming to address a real-world problem. This innovative system offers a more efficient and hygienic method of waste management, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable environment. 🌎♻️
